<h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
<p>
1. What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of information that's stored by a website on your computer. Like many other sites, NYTimes.com uses cookies to maintain user preferences and make it easier for you to use our site. For example, a cookie helps us identify you as a paid subscriber to our crossword puzzles when you come to our website. Cookies are encoded; we don’t store this information as plain text.
We can only access the information stored in the cookies we have placed on your computer. The information stored in your NYTimes.com cookies cannot be read by other sites or users. 
2. What is HTML5 local storage?
Like cookies, local storage (also known as Web Storage or DOM Storage) is a way for web pages to store information on your computer and makes it easier to use NYTimes.com. Your NYTimes.com local storage information is not accessible to other sites or users. 
3. Why does NYTimes.com use cookies and local storage?
These technologies make NYTimes.com easier to use. For example, if you select Remember me on this computer when you log in to NYTimes.com, we'll set a cookie to log you in automatically the next time you visit. If you later log out of NYTimes.com, the cookie is cleared. We place local storage on your computer so we can do things like store the number of articles you’ve read and back up the information stored in some NYTimes.com cookies. No personally identifiable information is kept in NYTimes.com local storage or cookies.
  
4. Can I stop cookies from being set and local storage from being used?
 
Yes — however our registration system requires that you accept cookies from NYTimes.com in order to log in to our website, and both cookies and local storage are used to enhance your experience on NYTimes.com. These technologies are not spyware, viruses or any other kind of malicious program and we do not store any sensitive information, like your billing address or name, in them.
